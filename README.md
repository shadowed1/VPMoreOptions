https://store.steampowered.com/app/2858370/Voxel_Project_VR/

**Features for 1.2X:**

- Spawn menu enabled for Arena and Siege.

- Fire enabled for Siege mode.
- C4 has a 2.5% chance to cause a small fire.

**How to Install**:

- Requires Melonloader 0.7.1.
- Run the game once with Melonloader and a Mods folder will be created in the game folder (Steam\steamapps\common\Voxel Project VR\Mods)
- Place VPMoreOptions.dll in the Mods folder and run the game.

**Known Issues:**

- Spawn Menu appears twice in Arena and Siege, but it doesn't harm anything.
- Sandbox mode is broken in Multiplayer, but Siege/Arena already have Sandbox built in. 

**How to Install MelonLoader 0.7.1 for Voxel Project VR 1.2X:**

- Download this nightly build of MelonLoader (subject to change when final release comes):
https://nightly.link/LavaGang/MelonLoader/actions/runs/15301935887/MelonLoader.Windows.x64.CI.Release

- Drag and drop into \Steam\steamapps\common\Voxel Project VR\ ,

__As of 1.22+ copying these .dlls are no longer required!__:
- Download  generic Unity .dll's from another Unity game. I recommend Schedule I: Free Sample on Steam as it is a free demo or download the same files I uploaded to Github:
https://github.com/shadowed1/VPMoreOptions/releases/tag/001

- Copy **mscorlib.dll, System.Core.dll, System.dll** from (or use Github link):
Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I Demo\Schedule I Free Sample_Data\Managed\ 
to:
Steam\steamapps\common\Voxel Project VR\Voxel Project_Data\Managed\ 

Run the game normally and MelonLoader should run alongside. A Mods folder will be created on first launch. Drag and drop mods into the mods folder and enjoy!
