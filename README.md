**How to Install MelonLoader 0.7.1 for Voxel Project VR 1.20.1:**

- Download this nightly build of MelonLoader (subject to change when final release comes):
https://nightly.link/LavaGang/MelonLoader/actions/runs/15301935887/MelonLoader.Windows.x64.CI.Release

- Drag and drop into \Steam\steamapps\common\Voxel Project VR\ ,

- Download  generic Unity .dll's from another Unity game. I recommend Schedule I: Free Sample on Steam as it is a free demo or download the same files I uploaded to Github:
https://github.com/shadowed1/VPMoreOptions/releases/tag/001

- Copy mscorlib.dll, System.Core.dll, System.dll from (or use Github link):
Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I Demo\Schedule I Free Sample_Data\Managed\ 
to:
Steam\steamapps\common\Voxel Project VR\Voxel Project_Data\Managed\ 

Run the game normally and MelonLoader should run alongside. A Mods folder will be created on first launch. Drag and drop mods into the mods folder and enjoy!
